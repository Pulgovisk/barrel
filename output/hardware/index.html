						 <p>Spring is coming in Berlin and thus my thoughts – as every year – are with plants and growing them. I live in an appartment with a tiny tiny balcony so I don't have much space but that has never stopped me from wanting to cram as many plants into the space as possible to the point of starting nuclear fusion.</p>
<p>In addition to that I have a few house-plants and very water-sensitive trees in my appartment. My current approach is to go around with a jug of water every couple of days and water them individually – making sure the soil has a certain moisture and doesn't exceed a certain limit – but I've always had the dream of being able to automate away as much as possible. That's where the idea of <code>Plantb0t</code> started. And I want to tell you a little bit about it.</p>
<p>The basic idea is to have a little controller in each plant-pot that measure the moisture of the soil and reports that back to me via an ESP-12 SOM (System on a Module). The ESP has WiFi capabilities and would log to an MQTT server on my home media server. This way (when I'm at home – none of that IoT shit) I can see how my plans are doing.</p>
<h1>Current state</h1>
<p>So that's what Revision A of Plantb0t is. I also added a second sensor slot which is meant to be populated by a temperature sensor but could theoretically house a second moisture sensor. In the end the probes are only sticks in the ground that have a resistance between them.</p>
<p>Here is a dynamic render of the board (that went into prototype production on the 29th of march, 2016).</p>
<p><img alt="Plantb0t Rev A" src="/images/plantb0t_RevA_front.png"></p>
<p>As you can see it's powered by an ESP-12 and comes with it's own programmer (The lovely CP2102) and micro-USB header. The USB-Port is currently the only way to power the board.</p>
<p>In the future it is planned to bypass the USB power and only use it for the programmer and otherwise drive everything off an externla powerboard which provides 3.3V for the Plantb0t.</p>
<p>In the bottom you see two constant current sources that can power two analogue sensors that get multiplexed into the ADC of the ESP-12.</p>
<p>GPIO pin headers are included for external gismoz such as a pump to act on the moisture data as well as screwholes to mount the whole thing in a 3D printed case.</p>
<p>In total the board is only 5x5cm big!</p>
<h1>Future plans</h1>
<p>A few things I want to realise with this project in the next coming weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primarily the Rev A board needs to be tested to make sure that the programmer works</li>
<li>Figure out a good way to calibrate the sensors. Maybe drive a button via GPIO?</li>
<li>Design a power board that generates 3.3V for the board (but not the programmer!) from a solar panel and a battery to decouple the entire sensor-board from all power-sockets.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the next revision of the board (Rev B) I want to include more sensor slots. Maybe work on the part spacing a bit and increase footprint sizes. It should be easier to solder and someof the parts are ridiculously small. I mean...I have the whole back to work with?</p>
<p>I also have some crazy ideas for a "Plantb0t+" Version with even MOAR SENSORS (Including a pH-value sensor!). But that's all faaaaar in the future.</p>
<p>Either way...I'm excited for my boards to get here (hopefully in the next 7-8 days) as well as all the parts I need for the prototypes.</p>
<p>I leave you with a screenshot from KiCad where you get to see under the hood of the board. Cheers o/</p>

						 <p>You might remember I played around with Kicad a few months ago and made this <a href="/hardware/jolly-christmas-decoration/">tacky little thing</a>. Just about 2 1/2 weeks ago I went onto <a href="http://dirtypcbs.com/">DirtyPCB</a> to get them actually made. I wanted to have gone through the production process and get something built before I started doing more complicated projects.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I discovered a little mistake with the design in the layout that ended up at the manufacturer (Rev 3.1). I tried to fix them but Rev 3.2 didn't make it in time, which means my boards will be a bit more complicated to power. However not too complicated as the power-in are just throughholes so I can actually strap anything behind it to power it.</p>
<p>But without further a due, here is the result from DirtyPCB (which I am actually quite impressed with …</p>

						 <p>Christmas is getting closer (not really but let's just roll with it) and I wanted to learn <a href="www.kicad-pcb.com">KiCad</a> a software that let's you create circuits and design PCB for manufacture.</p>
<p>I found a tutorial series online by a guy named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaBNA-lmg35Wfx2eh2oDkWg">Ashley Mills</a> (with quite a legendary beard) who showed off a simple circuit using a 555-timer, a shift register and an XOR gate made from NPN transistors and resistors to display and repeat a pattern on several LED's.</p>
<p>The series focused on getting to know KiCad and all it's features. And while I did that in the first revision of my board, I've diverged from it since. I can however recommend his videos on KiCad to anyone who wants to dive into PCB design, has no clue about the software and could use a little chuckle while also learning some …</p>
