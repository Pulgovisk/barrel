						 <p>I'm late to the party, I know.
But writing this post took a little longer.
In fact, I wrote it three times, not really sure where I wanted it to go and what I wanted to say.
In the end, I think most things have already been said.
So this will be short.</p>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>There have been a great number of blog posts about the problems that the Rust community is facing.
I recommend you read some of them because they're really good.
For example <a href="https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/rust-2019/">boats</a> who published an article early december about "Organisational Dept".
Or <a href="https://deterministic.space/rust-2019.html">killercup</a> about how we count contributions (and other things).
Or <a href="https://yakshav.es/rust-2019/">skade</a>, who published a small collection of articles on organisational subjects.</p>
<p>There's many more under the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rust2019&amp;src=typed_query">#rust2019</a> hashtag on twitter.</p>
<p>My point is: you can read about what the issues are elsewhere, from more perspectives.
There's no point in me trying to rehash the same stuff again.
I'm not that good a writer that I will bring anything to the table that these people haven't already.</p>
<p>In my opinion the issues we have at the moment are because of two things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teams that have too much responsibility</li>
<li>Bad tools</li>
</ul>
<p>(I won't really talk about the tools issue in this post.
In summary: the tools we use to communicate are all garbage.
And github and discourse comments are terrible for debates.
Really, any linear chat platform is terrible
- there might be another article at some point)</p>
<p>As I've said, there are plenty of articles that go 
into <em>what</em> is the problem with our current process.
I want to focus on the <em>why</em>, <em>how</em> and <em>how we stop it</em> bit of that.</p>
<p>And first we need to talk about how things are built.</p>
<h2>Vision vs Implementation</h2>
<p>Fundamentally there are two parts to design:</p>
<p><strong>Vision</strong> is what drives a project forward, 
creating new concepts and thinking about their implications,
while <strong>Implementation</strong> is finding the most elegant, 
sustainable and performant way of making vision a reality!</p>
<p>Now, these two can very often not be separated as easily as I make it out there.
Take the example of the CLI-WG.
When we first assembled earlier this year, we started working on a vision:
"how should CLI development look".
What followed then was an implementation of the vision, 
as closely as we could manage with the resources and time available.
I would argue that during the implementation period of the vision,
some aspects of <em>what</em> we thought should be done
were influenced by things we learned about <em>how</em> to do them.
Like hitting a moving target.
To some extent this is how most software development works,
unless you are working towards a <em>very</em> well defined spec!</p>
<p>Having the same group of people be in charge of both the overall 
vision for a system and it's implementation isn't a bad thing,
<em>given that the system is small enough!</em></p>
<p>And this is where teams come in!
Splitting up the community into smaller groups who work on the same stuff,
so that this kind of collaboration becomes possible again.</p>
<p>In a way, the Rust 2018 working groups were inspired by the same idea.
The difference between teams and working groups being,
that the latter has a more loosely defined governance structure and allows people
to join and collaborate easier and more quickly.
There's less "established structure" in a working group.
These lower barriers are one of the reasons why I'm a huge fan of working groups,
and feel like the Rust project should expand on them in the future.
Maybe some teams could even be replaced.</p>
<p>But that's not fundamentally the issue that the project is facing.</p>
<h2>Blurring the lines</h2>
<p>Problems arise when these lines are blurred too much.
This happens with both discussions, as well as to teams of people,
who get involved in too many things.
Ultimately, we need to face the fact that days are short,
people's time is limited and the number of responsibilities a single person can have
isn't infinite!</p>
<p>Througout previous blog posts and conversations with others,
the need or "desire" to have better communication channels has been made clear.
And I feel that we need to work on the way that we communicate,
if we are ever to fix the way that we make decisions.</p>
<p>But before I go into detail about what that means to <em>me</em>, specifically,
I want to talk quickly about the core team.</p>
<p>The core team is a medium sized group of Rust developers,
who oversee large areas of the development of Rust.
As the website puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overall direction and policies of the project,
subteam leadership, cross-cutting concerns. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As such, I feel it would be the perfect candidate to step back from implementation,
and focus on both vision for the entire language,
as well as communication among smaller teams.
Unfortunately this hasn't seemed to be the case in the past
and is something the core team should work on this year.</p>
<p>Note that I think, that this is a responsibly that should also not be taken lightly.
Most of the members of the core team are also active in other teams,
sometimes even leading them.
I feel that this is one of the reasons why this role has been neglected.</p>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<p>So I would sugest something, that I've heard others talk about before,
although rarely publicly, which might be considered a bit of a hot take.</p>
<p>The core team should be rotated.</p>
<p>What that means is that the core team in itself still exists,
does a certain number of jobs and should be considered quite a time-intensive commitment.
But the people involved in it shouldn't stay involved with it forever.
Even if it's currently (practically) already the case that the team rotates,
making this more explicit and making the roles of the core team a central part of
how other teams communicate and operate, I feel would benefit the overall
contribution climate of the rust project significantly.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we have a problem in how we communicate.
The lines between <em>vision</em> and <em>implementation</em> get blurred too often.
Not only in RFC discussions. 
Implementation specific bikesheds on github
often result in new rationale being pushed forward,
that have nothing to do with the actual question at hand.
And as such, people often talk past each other.</p>
<p>I don't know how wide the communication scope of the core team should be,
but I definitely think that moving it's responsibility away from implementation
and back towards communication and fostering collaboration between teams and working groups
is the approach we will have to take this year to solve our problems of
Organisational dept!</p>

It was my fourth one in total, and now the third in a row
(the first being 25C3 as a smol girl).</p>
<p>It's hard to describe the C3 (abreviation for the congress, opposed to the CCC, the club).
Some call it a "hacker conference" which is...in some ways accurate,
but often doesn't manage to capture what it is.
Not to mention relies on the external definition of a "hacker" to describe it.
Other's call it a "tech event" or "tech conference" which really isn't accurate either.
There are lots of artists and non-tech people represented
and I feel these experiences shouldn't be ignored.</p>

<p>Recently I've started learning/ using Moonscript. It's a language that compiles to <a href="https://www.lua.org/">lua</a> and as such can run in the LuaJIT, an alternative lua engine which allows very easy and <em>fast</em> ffi calls into native code. This makes lua code capable of writing very performant applications and games that use native rendering, window creation or general libraries.</p>
<p>But in my opinion lua has always felt a bit cumbersome. I use awesomewm so I had to write it occasionally to customise my UI layout. And this is where Moonscript comes in. It's a lot of syntactic sugar on top of lua as well as some other concepts such as object orientation which lua just plain out doesn't have. And while yes, you can write good code without OO (<em>cough</em>  <strong>C</strong> <em>cough</em>) it is a nice tool to have in your pocket …</p>

<p>I'm currently working myself into <a href="https://tls.mbed.org/">mbed.tls</a> which is the crypto library which was chosen to power the cryptographic backend for libqaul (which powers qaul.net).</p>

<p>But let me go back a little bit. A couple of weeks ago I sat in the basement of my local hackerspace talking to a friend about crypto when somebody joined the conversation, asking if I was a student and if I might be interested in Google Summer of Code.</p>
<p>After I looked up the project and familiarised myself with what had to be done, I thought it would be interesting to try to apply. And so I did. I wrote a long-ish proposal of what I wanted to do, how I would do it and when exactly I would acomplish my goals.

<p>Fuck...I don't have a backup.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>How to debug</h1>
<p>Now...not to worry, after some time I was dropped into a recovery console where I could ask very simple questions like what kernel modules were present and what Systemd had been up to. And at first I thought the problem was clear: <code>Module failed to load: vboxdrv</code> and other messages populated my screen – all about VirtualBox kernel modules …</p>

						 <p>Christmas is getting closer (not really but let's just roll with it) and I wanted to learn <a href="www.kicad-pcb.com">KiCad</a> a software that let's you create circuits and design PCB for manufacture.</p>
<p>I found a tutorial series online by a guy named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaBNA-lmg35Wfx2eh2oDkWg">Ashley Mills</a> (with quite a legendary beard) who showed off a simple circuit using a 555-timer, a shift register and an XOR gate made from NPN transistors and resistors to display and repeat a pattern on several LED's.</p>
<p>The series focused on getting to know KiCad and all it's features. And while I did that in the first revision of my board, I've diverged from it since. I can however recommend his videos on KiCad to anyone who wants to dive into PCB design, has no clue about the software and could use a little chuckle while also learning some …</p>

						 <p>Hey everybody, long time no read.</p>
<p>As I returned from vacation on the Chaos Communication Camp 2015 (Not sure if I'll post more about that) and probably starting a new job next week (<em>pssst</em> not sure if I should talk about it 😉 ) the rest of my summer is still ahead of me and I'm booming with ideas and inspiration to do stuff.</p>
<p>I've started more intensively coding on the <code>newdawn</code> branch of Reedb, the C port of the database and planning some features for the old codebase via the <code>backports</code> branch. Because the new codebase will use a different crypto backend (from OpenSSL to gnu_crypt) a migration agent will be neccesary to migrate between 0.11.x to 0.12+ vaults. But as very few people currently use Reedb and most setups are for testing purposes only that isn't a …</p>
